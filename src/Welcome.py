- **Member Lookup** does the same thing, but you can isolate specific congress members and view all their trades
- **EDA** allows you to explore the data and see the impact of Congress members' disclosures on the industry
- **Appendix** is a report that explains our processes and analysis

    #### Acknowledgements
    1. Unusual Whales is a group that came out with a viral report on Congress members' stock trades. They have been a source of inspiration for our project as well as a source for calculation methodologies.
    2. The New York Times article on Congress Stock Trades: [NYT Article: Stock Trades Reported by Nearly a Fifth of Congress Show Possible Conflicts](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/09/13/us/politics/congress-stock-trading-investigation.html) gave us the idea to analyze conflicts of interest in Congress.
    3.  Information on trades made by members of Congress is from the [House and Senate Stock Watcher API](https://senatestockwatcher.com/api) which is a free and real-time API that provides information on trades made by members of Congress based on their financial disclosures from the STOCK Act.
