## Proposal


This research proposal, "Performance of Potential Congressional Insider Trades vs. S&P 500," investigates whether trades made by U.S. Congress members that are classified as insider trading outperform the S&P 500. The study uses comprehensive data, including Congress trades from the Senate Stock Watcher API and S&P 500 data from Yahoo Finance, to analyze the ethical implications and market impacts of these trades. The research distinguishes itself by integrating detailed analysis with automated return calculations, providing new insights into Congressional trading behaviors.

## Report

This report investigates congressional stock trades, focusing on whether lawmakers achieve abnormally high returns, how their political affiliations may influence their trading decisions, and the impact of their committee memberships on investment choices in specific industries. This project responds to a decline in public trust in government officials and examines the effects of the STOCK Act of 2012. 

The research tests hypotheses concerning the performance of congressional insider trading against the S&P 500 and the influence of committee-related trades on stock performance. Using various data sources and computational methods, the study processes and analyzes transaction data to calculate cumulative returns and assess performance. 

Initial findings suggest that while the average returns from Congressional and insider-flagged trades do not consistently outperform the market, top insiders show significant outperformance, indicating potential insider advantages. The report concludes with a call for further investigation and stricter regulations on Congressional trading.
